							<h1 align="left">Overview</h1>
							<p align="left">
								In this project, we are expanding upon our work from project 3-1. We elected to do parts 1 and 4, which are adding mirror and glass materials for rendering and adding depth of field respectively. The first part utilizes reflection and refraction concepts in order to model the behavior of non-matte materials, which allows us to expand our repertoire of bsdfs. After completing part four, we can produce impressive images that are similar to those captured with a real camera. This is because real cameras have a complex system of lenses, and we are trying to replicate that by using the thin lens model rather than defaulting to the pinhole model as we have done in project 3-1. Luckily for us, most of this project was smooth sailing. It was key to always double check whether we were in camera or world space, as well as keeping to the wo and wi conventions when it came to implementing reflection/refraction in part 1. Otherwise, no major roadblocks were encountered!
							</p>
							<h1 align="left">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h1>
							<p align="left">
								In order to add glass and mirror materials to our rendering capabilities, we had to fill in the reflection and refraction helper functions. These two allowed us to populate the wi vector correctly for later use when sampling. The reflection equation we used was:
								<br> *wi = -wo + 2.0 * dot(wo, Vector3D(0, 0, 1)) * Vector3D(0, 0, 1),
								<br> where Vector3D(0, 0, 1) represents the normal since we are in object space here. The refraction logic was a little more complex, since we are only given one index of refraction and have to figure out whether we are entering or exiting the medium depending on the sign of the z coordinate. Then, we adjusted eta accordingly with the given ior from the arguments. Finally, our equation looked like this:
								<br> *wi = Vector3D(-eta * wo.x, -eta * wo.y, sqrt(1 - eta * eta * (1 - wo.z * wo.z))),
								<br> where we would manually change the sign of the z position to be opposite that of the wo.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Then, we just had to make sure to call those helper functions correctly while sampling, as well as setting the pdf for these special cases. We also have to make sure to return the correct values: transmittance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) / eta / eta for refraction in order to cancel out the abs_cos_theta(*wi) term, and the eta^2 adjusts for the radiance change when the medium light travels through changes. Similarly, we return reflectance / abs_cos_theta(*wi) for reflection. It’s important to note that we don’t have to adjust with eta^2 here because we are not changing the radiance of the ray at all. Everything gets reflected the same – with the exception of the direction.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Finally, in order to correctly render glass, we combine our refract and reflect logic. Glass is a material that performs both, and we can approximate the behavior by using a glorified coin flip with Schlick’s reflection coefficient. This way, our renderer doesn’t have to worry about branching out two rays and any intersection. We also have to be cautious about the case of a total internal reflection, which is when nothing will emerge from the surface of the new medium because everything is reflected back. We handle that case in the refract helper function, and simply process and return false in the sampling function. After all these steps, we are ready to render images!
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								The following images were rendered from CBspheres.dae: -t 8 -s 1024 -l 4 -m xyz -r 480 360, where xyz was the maximum ray depth specified (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100).

								Through this sequence of images, we can observe how the changes in bounce numbers (or effectively, the changes in max_ray_depth) can generate various multibounce effects that are rendered in the scene.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 0, the only light that is rendered within the image is a result of what is emitted directly from the area light source into the camera. As this is essentially representative of light from this source entering the camera after zero bounces in total, there are no multibounce effects present within this image.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 1, the light that is emitted from the area light source bounces off of the floor and walls exactly once into the camera. In this scene, we can visualize the fact that rays of light typically only bounce once; this is why the floor and the walls are the only two components of the scene that appear in full. There are also different renders on the surface of the spheres – while light is reflected off of the mirror-like sphere (on the left) into the camera, it is both reflected off of and refracted into the glass-like sphere (on the right).
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 2, we can finally observe a few multibounce effects. Foremost, we can see how various components in the scene (essentially: the red / blue walls, area light source, and the floor) are reflected upon the surfaces of both spheres – although it is key to note that this reflection is more clear and striking on the mirror-like sphere, while it is relatively obscure and muted on the glass-like sphere. This effect is created as a result of two bounces, in which the first bounce is a result of light from the area source bouncing off of any of the five core frames of the scene (or the floor and walls) towards the two spheres, and the second bounce is a result of that light bouncing from the spheres into the camera. On the surfaces of both spheres, the reflected ceiling is still rendered black. Once again, this is a result of two bounces, similar to what is described above but with the ceiling as the destination of the first bounce and the source of the second one. The final notable multibounce effect here is that the glass-like sphere is reflected upon the mirror-like sphere, which is due to the fact that the light bounces off of the glass-like sphere first, then onto the mirror-like sphere, and then into the camera.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 3, a few new multibounce effects appear. Foremost, the ceiling on both spheres is finally rendered at its intended color of gray, instead of merely being black. This is particularly noticeable in the mirror-like sphere, in which the ceiling of the scene is at an appropriate focus. This effect can only be produced as a result of three bounces, in which the first two represent a “back-and-forth” motion between the ceiling and the mirror-like sphere, and the last one is the final bounce off of the sphere into the camera. Additionally, another multibounce effect is that light is refracted on the glass-like sphere to cause the light to change direction on the surface of the sphere. Once again, this effect is produced as a result of three bounces, in which the first two represent a “back-and-forth” motion between the floor / walls of the scene and the exterior and interior of the glass-like sphere, and the last one is the final bounce off of the sphere into the camera.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 4, there are yet again more multibounce effects. Foremost, the glass-like sphere that is reflected upon the surface of the mirror-like sphere is fully visible (ie. it is in color and not merely rendered in black). This effect can only be produced as a result of four bounces, in which the first one is a bounce from the blue wall to the glass-like sphere, the next two represent a “back-and-forth” motion where light is refracted in and out of that sphere, and the last one is a bounce from the sphere into the camera. The order of these four bounces also create additional effects within the scene – the background of the glass-like sphere is now filled in with a lighter gradient and a light “shadow” effect of the glass-like sphere is present on the adjacent blue wall.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 5, a few more multibounce effects appear, although they are less significant than the past few iterations. Foremost, the components that are reflected (essentially: the red / blue walls, area light source, and the floor) onto the surfaces of the spheres are visually depicted in more detail and appear to be more bright in hue. The aforementioned four bounces from the previous section still occur here, and an additional bounce is created from the walls to the glass-like sphere. This effectively ensures that more light is able to bounce into the camera, which helps explain why all of the reflected components on the spheres are much lighter in color.
								<br> <br> When the max_ray_depth is set to 100, yet a few more multibounce effects are present. However, they are not nearly as impactful as the initial few iterations, as the impact of increasing the number of bounces upon details in the scene stabilizes over time. One key aspect to note here is that as the number of bounces drastically increases (or is at 100), the entire scene appears to be rendered much more “smooth” and faded-out, whether that be the shadows of the spheres upon the floor or the reflected components (essentially: the red / blue walls, area light source, and the floor) upon their surfaces.

							<h1 align="left">Part 4: Depth of Field</h1>
							<p align="left">
								A pinhole camera model assumes that the only contribution to a pixel is through a small hole located at (0, 0, 0) in camera space. This means that everything is snapped into focus, as there aren’t “competing” contributions when rendering each pixel. On the other hand, the thin lens model takes into consideration a whole disk of possibilities that the pixel could receive radiance through. This results in some parts of the image being in focus (parts that are exactly the focal distance away from the lens). Other parts of the image are receiving a range of input – these parts contain objects that are either closer or further than the focal distance, so the rays originating from the same pixel may hit different parts of the object, resulting in a blurrier focus.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								In order to implement this, we completed the function generate_ray_for_thin_lens. Similar to project 3-1 part 1, we computed the outgoing direction from a pixel to the center of the lens in camera space. Then, we used the fact that rays going through the center of the lens do not get refracted at all, and multiplied the outgoing direction by the focal distance in order to compute the intersection between the focal plane and the ray. This gives us the pFocus point that all rays traced from the pixel of interest will pass through after going through the lens. Then, we can randomly sample the disk representing the thin lens by using a random R sampled between 0 and 1, as well as a random theta sampled between 0 and 2pi. After taking into consideration how points are distributed, one will realize the radius distribution is not uniform if only randomly picked from 0 and 1. In fact, a specific radius’ occurrence corresponds to the circumference, which leads to a r^2 cumulative density function, so we need to square root it to get a uniformly distributed radius sampling. Then, we scale it with the lens radius and sin or cos of the random theta in order to get the y or x coordinate of pLens. Finally, we set the z of pLens to 0 since the lens is set on z=0. Now we simply trace the ray from pLens to pFocus and return this ray of interest. Of course, one must also remember to apply a camera to world coordinate change and normalize any vectors as needed in order to fit with convention that we’ve used so far.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								In order to demonstrate the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model, we can alter the focal distance in order to focus on different depths in each image. This is contrasted with the pinhole camera model, where everything is simultaneously in focus.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Here’s a focus stack of ../../../dae/sky/CBdragon.dae rendered with the following settings:
								<br> -t 8 -s 256 -l 4 -m 12 -b 1.23 -d 4.56 -r 480 360 -f writeup_dragon_01.png

							<img src="writeup_dragon_04.png">
							<p align="left">
								<br> As demonstrated, these images are rendered to focus from the front to the back, until the dragon is a blurry splotch and the background is more in focus.
							</p>
							<p align="left">
								Now, we can explore altering the other parameter – the aperture size. To do this, we are essentially altering the -d option, which is the lens radius. In the next sequence of images rendered, all are focused on the same plane (so the -b parameter denoting the focal distance remains constant). This can be validated by observing that the back of the jaw / front of the torso area remains in focus in all the images. That area represents the slice of the object that is focal distance away from the lens. Now, we will see that going from descending aperture size results in a transition from a blurrier to sharper out-of-focus region, comparatively speaking. This is because the “circle of confusion” is larger when the aperture size is bigger, as discussed in lecture.

							<p align="left">
								Celeste spearheaded tasks 1.1 to 1.3 while Rupa spearheaded tasks 1.4 and 4.1. We both worked on the writeup together, making sure to switch off (so Celeste spearheaded part 4 writeup etc.) in order to gain a complete understanding of each part that we completed. Everything went smoothly and we are happy to report that we feel accomplished with the process, as well as the final renderings that we have obtained. It is definitely a very satisfying feeling to see things fall into place!

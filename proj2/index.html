		    <p align="left">
			    In its simplest form, de Casteljau’s algorithm provides a way to calculate the position of a point on a line segment. It utilizes linear interpolation between the two endpoints of a line segment to choose a point that is on the line, such that the ratio of the distance between one endpoint to this point and the total distance between the two endpoints is t; in the algorithm, t is a modifiable parameter within the range of (0, 1). This concept can be extended recursively in order to evaluate Bezier curves. Given a Bezier curve of degree n, de Casteljau’s algorithm can be used to form it by performing a linear interpolation between two curves of degree n - 1. Each of these n - 1 degree curves are formed by n control points, so a linear interpolation is calculated between each consecutive set of n - 1 points. Ultimately, another linear interpolation is calculated between those results in order to form the Bezier curve of degree n.

			    This was done through the evaluateStep() function, which took in a vector of n control points as input. The function looped through these n points, and extracted each point i and its consecutive neighbor i + 1 to insert them into a linear interpolation equation with the parameter t. This yielded an intermediate point i’. All n of these intermediate points ultimately form the intermediate control points for the next subdivision level. Overall, these calculations are done recursively in order to relate the control points as a smooth, continuous Bezier curve.
